                <h2>Future sw developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I was always attracted by information technology. So finally decided
                    to make a step forward and start my studies to become sw developer.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love (beside inf. technology:) nature. We spend almost all weekends 
                    at weekend house - in the middle (almost) of nowhere - with my family. 
                    I work often with wood and outside on the garden.

                <h4>Logic gate</h4>
    
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, 
                    it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
                </p>
    
                <h4>ASCII</h4>
    
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, 
                     so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
                </p>   
                    
                <h4>RAM - Random Access Memory</h4>

                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase 
                    the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost 
                    the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
                </p>
                    
                <h4>Computer Programm</h4>

                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
                    They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
                </p>
                    
                <h4>DNS - Domain Name Service</h4>

                <p> A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
                    It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
